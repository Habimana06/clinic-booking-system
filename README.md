# 🏥 Clinic Booking System (MySQL Project)

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Clinic Booking System** is a structured relational database project built entirely using **MySQL**. It simulates a real-world clinic environment, enabling efficient management of patients, doctors, appointments, departments, and payments.

This system ensures **data integrity**, **referential accuracy**, and **easy query handling** using proper constraints like primary keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and NOT NULL checks. It’s ideal for small to medium clinics that want to digitize their booking process.
